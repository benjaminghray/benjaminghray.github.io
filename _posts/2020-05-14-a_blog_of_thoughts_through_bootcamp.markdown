I'm 23 years old and have been in cooking in kitchens since i was 17.  I was 20 years old when I got promoted to Chef, thus beginning my career in culinary arts and management. The feeling of personally executing a dish with intent and purpose and building a team who believes in that intent or purpose is what made me excel. Being a chef was also a way out for me, a way to better my life. The Covid-19 pandemic hit and I was furloughed, only to be laid off shortly after. My restaurant was closed, and my career had come to an abrubt standstill. I quickly realized that this is a once in a millennium opportunity to pursue a career path that most deeply connects with my creative side with the perfect platform for expression. A man cant tell a story without first knowing the language in which to tell it, and I cant create something memorable whether an app or website or blog, without first knowing the language in which to convey my thoughts to the computer. I am attending this bootcamp in hopes to gain the foundation I need to excel in my new career.
